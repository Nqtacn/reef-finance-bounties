Development
To start working on your project, run

yarn build
then include the plugin in your hardhat repo with yarn link.

CI versioning
Versioning is done with the GH action: https://github.com/mikeal/merge-release.

Based on the commit messages, the version will be incremented from the latest release:

If the string "BREAKING CHANGE" is found anywhere in any of the commit messages or descriptions the major version will be incremented.
If a commit message begins with the string "feat" then the minor version will be increased. This works for most common commit metadata for feature additions: "feat: new API" and "feature: new API".
All other changes will increment the patch version.
